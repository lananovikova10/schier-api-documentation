# Product Rating

A flow rate/capacity configuration for a product that dictates the amount of flow and grease capacity that it can have. Multiple ratings can be applied to a single product; adding support for a higher flow rate at the sacrifice for a lower capacity.

Each value of the Product Rating object comes with both a US standard calculation and a metric equivalent.
