# Product Images

There are two sets of images that are included with each product response from our API. Each set has been named for their desired role. Additionally, each image type/set also includes **four different** sizes. Each image size has been optimized for the web.  

{type="full"}
primary
: An image that is design for marketing collateral or to appear on websites. The image has been cleaned up and is on a transparent background to allow for multiple uses.

dimension
: The dimension image is essentially the primary image, with all the same treatment, but also includes dimension tick marks and notations. This image is intended for specification documentation or other technical writing.

Each image type (primary/dimension) includes an instance of the `PhotoLibrary` object; as outlined below.
