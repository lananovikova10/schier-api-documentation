# Product Types

Product types are, in essence, a type of category system that Schier's products are grouped into. These product types dictate the features/jobs that they perform and how they fit into the Schier product family.

## Base Endpoints

```HTTP
GET /product-types
GET /product-types/:type
GET /product-types/:type/products
```
